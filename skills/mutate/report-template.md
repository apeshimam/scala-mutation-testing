### Quality Rating

{{quality_rating}}

| Score Range | Rating | Meaning |
|------------|--------|---------|
| 90–100% | **Strong** | Test suite thoroughly verifies behavior |
| 75–89% | **Adequate** | Good coverage with some gaps |
| 60–74% | **Weak** | Significant behavioral gaps in tests |
| Below 60% | **Critical** | Tests do not adequately verify code behavior |

## Field Definitions

### Quality Rating
Calculate based on kill rate (killed / (killed + survived)):
- **90–100%**: "**Strong** — Test suite thoroughly verifies the behavioral intent of this code."
- **75–89%**: "**Adequate** — Good behavioral coverage with some gaps to address."
- **60–74%**: "**Weak** — Significant behavioral gaps. The surviving mutations represent untested business logic."
- **Below 60%**: "**Critical** — Tests do not adequately verify the code's behavior. Major test improvements needed."

Note: Incompilable and timed-out mutations are excluded from the kill rate calculation.

### Result Emoji Mapping
- `KILLED` → ✅
- `SURVIVED` → 🟡
- `INCOMPILABLE` → ⚠️
- `TIMEOUT` → ⏱️

### Recommendation Priorities
Number recommendations by priority (1 = highest). Focus on:
1. Surviving mutations that represent the most critical business logic gaps
2. Entire untested categories (e.g., no Option handling tests)
3. Specific test cases that would kill multiple surviving mutations at once
4. Structural test improvements (e.g., "Add boundary condition tests for method X")

### Location Format
Use `ClassName.methodName:lineNumber` format, e.g., `UserService.validateEmail:42`.

### Suggested Test Code
Write complete, runnable ScalaTest test cases. Use the same style as the project's existing tests. Include:
- A descriptive test name
- Setup/given section
- Action/when section
- Assertion/then section
